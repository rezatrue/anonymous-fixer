P E R S O N A L



My husband of 14 years and two well behaved, intelligent
children and I have lived in Brunswick, Georgia since 1998. Christine
is thirteen and David is 11. My husband,Ralph, formally worked as an
anesthesiologist. He now uses his medical degree in
the field of Alternative Medicine. I was born in Danville,
Pennsylvania, grew up in New Brunswick, New Jersey and Scotch Plains,
New Jersey. I worked for 13 years in the laboratory profession in a
hospital Blood Bank in Florida. For the past 14 years I have attended
to the needs of my children while getting “on the job training” in the
field of education by volunteering at their schools so much that I was
hired for substitute teaching. I organized the first chess club at a
local elementary school. I also gained people-skills while working
with my husband at his business as Office Manager/Receptionist
involving medical records, supplies, billing, payroll and patient
needs. My passion is creating crafts from discarded items to use as
decorations, give as gifts and sell at flea markets.
