*Downsized by company

* As a the Payroll Clerk for Haddon my duties included daily
data entry of hourly employee time, printing labels, as well as running
and distributing weekly reports. After the company implemented an
electronic ID badge system in December of 2000, I was responsible to
train approximately 350 to 400 hourly employees on how to use the new
swipe system. I also took both salary and hourly photos and created
their photo ID badges. During New Hire Orientations I was in charge of
instructing the new hires on how to properly fill out time sheets as
well as the electronic swiping. Due to a corporate issue the ID badge
system was put on hold, but Haddon did not want the employees to stop
swiping in and out so they were to use time sheets and ID badges
simultaneously. During my five-year span with Haddon I was stationed in
the Receptionist area for a little over a year and a half. Out front I
was responsible for answering the multi-line phone system, correctly
directing incoming calls, paging employees and assisting all of the
visiting customers and vendors. These were in addition to my regular
Payroll job duties.
