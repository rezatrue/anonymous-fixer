Hobbies: Camping, snowmobiling, hiking, rafting, pet rescue programs,
hospice volunteer, American Red Cross volunteer. I am married with 3
college children. My husband and I want to relocate in the Asheville
area as much for the climate as the outdoor activities. I am looking
for an exciting employment opportunity. I have lots of personal
experience to share and I am at a time in my life where I need to make
a career move. I enjoy a challenge and the knowledge I would bring
would be an asset to any company.
