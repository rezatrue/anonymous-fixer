Resume

June 17, 2013
 
To Whom It May Concern:
 
I am applying for a primary care position with Scottsdale Health Care. Although my background is summarized in my resume, I would like to share with you Janis Saunders D.O., the person, the educator, the physician.
 
I began my career in public education where I taught high school mathematics, chemistry, and English for thirteen years. Although I decided to change careers in my thirties, I approached my medical experiences from the viewpoint of an educator. I explore with my patients not only what is wrong with their health, but why a problem may have occurred, and what lifestyle modifications they can make to help alleviate it. This kind of approach to medicine, to educate as well as treat, is of great benefit to all medical populations.
 
In addition, I have always been actively involved in community education as a physician, frequently giving lectures for lay groups of all ages. If the position involves community outreach, I will plan and execute any necessary educational activities.
 
My resume cannot give you a feel for my extensive experience caring for hospitalized patients. When I practiced with Scottsdale Family Care in Arizona, I was the hospital call doctor for up to twenty physicians at least six weekends per year. I was responsible on these weekends for the care of all hospitalized patients for that group and for admitting all of our patients to two hospitals. I also admitted and cared for all of my own patients during the week. Although it is my goal for all of my patients to keep them out of the hospital, I am fully capable of providing for their care if they are hospitalized.
 
In addition, I have worked in an urgent care setting and have acquired skills in trauma medicine and industrial medicine. I have also worked part time with prisoners, providing health care at the Oakland County Jail in Oakland County, Michigan. Although most of my experience in my own private practice was women’s health, most recently in Arizona I have also done general medicine including gerontology and manipulation.
 
Several years ago, an addiction problem in my family prompted me to take the training to receive federal certification to manage Suboxone substance abuse prevention. In Fountain Hills, I have had a small but critically necessary detoxification program as part of my practice activities.
 
Finally, my approach to patient future-care is always preventively based. I teach patients to be proactive about health needs rather than reactive, to anticipate by family history and disease patterns where their most likely health issues will arise, and how to plan for prevention and early detection.
 
In summary, I am a physician educator with strong skills in the areas of basic primary care, hospital care, and community education. As an Osteopathic physician, I bring a holistic approach to person-care as well as skills in manipulation. I will be an asset to your program and to the medical community it serves.
 
Thank you for your consideration.
Janis Saunders D.O.
