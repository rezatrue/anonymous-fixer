skills and where my commitment to delivering high-quality software will
be put to use in a challenging environment.

PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

•Developed a Visual Basic URL Verification application to automatically

BLUE SHIELD OF CALIFORNIA, San Francisco, CA
Lead Application Developer Nov 2001 - Apr 2003

Developed a critical multi-user application and database (VB.NET,

•Poor application and database design
•Poor coding techniques

The new client application was developed in VB.NET and C#. Visio for
Enterprise Architects and Erwin were used to design and model the
application and the new Oracle database. Reports were created in
Crystal Reports and were made available in PDF, Word, Excel and HTML.

Success in this project was achieved by:
•Quickly coming up to speed on the HEDIS healthcare specification and
developing a requirements document
•Working closely with the project manager and business users
•Choosing the correct tools for the client’s environment
•Implementing proper coding standards and object oriented techniques
•Instituting a software testing program

system

•Designed and coded the flagship software product using Microsoft
technologies (VB6, C++, SQL Server, MS Access, HTML, XML and TCPIP,

•Features of the application included seamless connectivity to various
